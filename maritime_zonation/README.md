# How to distinguish maritime zones?

To sort samples from a specific maritime zone, the coordinates of samples should be overlapped with reference areas of these zones.

<br />
 
For that, a reference file is required. In our case, shapefiles from [Marine Regions](https://www.marineregions.org) under the CC BY 4.0 licence are used.
> Due to copyright reasons, please, obtain these files on your own :shipit:

<br />
 
The pipeline has the following major steps:
- uploading reference shapefiles (as a path to a folder with zips);
- uploading a table with samples (it should contain columns Latitude and Longitude);
- overlapping them to see how many areas samples fall into;
- visualisation of results;
- saving a sample table with a new column reflecting maritime zones.
